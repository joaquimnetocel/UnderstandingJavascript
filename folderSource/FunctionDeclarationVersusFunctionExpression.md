# FUNCTION EXPRESSION VS FUNCTION DECLARATION

LET'S FORMULATE THE KEY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN FUNCTION DECLARATIONS AND EXPRESSIONS.

FIRST, THE SYNTAX: HOW TO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN THEM IN THE CODE.

* FUNCTION DECLARATION: A FUNCTION, DECLARED AS A SEPARATE STATEMENT, IN THE MAIN CODE FLOW:

```javascript
// FUNCTION DECLARATION
function functionSum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
/////
```

* FUNCTION EXPRESSION: A FUNCTION, CREATED INSIDE AN EXPRESSION OR INSIDE ANOTHER SYNTAX CONSTRUCT.

```javascript
// FUNCTION EXPRESSION
const functionSum = function(a, b) {
  return a + b;
};
/////
```

THE MORE SUBTLE DIFFERENCE IS WHEN A FUNCTION IS CREATED BY THE JAVASCRIPT ENGINE. A FUNCTION EXPRESSION IS CREATED WHEN THE EXECUTION REACHES IT AND IS USABLE ONLY FROM THAT MOMENT.

```javascript
// FUNCTION BEEN EXECUTED BEFORE CREATION (IT IS GOING TO FIRE AN ERROR).
functionSum(2,5); // ERROR
/////
// FUNCTION EXPRESSION
const functionSum = function(a, b) {
  return a + b;
};
/////
```

FUNCTION DECLARATIONS ARE DIFFERENT. A FUNCTION DECLARATION CAN BE CALLED EARLIER THAN IT IS DEFINED:

```javascript
// FUNCTION BEEN EXECUTED BEFORE DECLARATION (NO PROBLEM)
functionSum(2,5); // SHOWS: 7
/////
// FUNCTION DECLARATION
function functionSum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
/////
```

THAT IS DUE TO INTERNAL ALGORITHMS. WHEN JAVASCRIPT PREPARES TO RUN THE SCRIPT, IT FIRST LOOKS FOR FUNCTION DECLARATIONS IN IT AND CREATES THE FUNCTIONS. WE CAN THINK OF IT AS AN “INITIALIZATION STAGE”. AND AFTER ALL FUNCTION DECLARATIONS ARE PROCESSED, THE CODE IS EXECUTED. SO IT HAS ACCESS TO THESE FUNCTIONS.
